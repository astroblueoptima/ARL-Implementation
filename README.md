# ARL: Autonomous Reinforcement Learning 🚀

Venture into reinforcement learning with a focus on autonomy. ARL emphasizes agents' capability to learn and act in environments without explicit instructions, emphasizing exploration, learning, and optimization.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **True Autonomy**: Agents discover goals and optimize paths without prior knowledge.
- **Grid World Showcase**: Understand ARL through a basic, yet insightful, RL environment.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Observe the agent's ability to adapt and refine its strategies.
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative evaluations of the ARL agent versus traditional counterparts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   # Download the ARL implementation
   cd path-to-downloaded-files
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install required-libraries
3. **Run the ARL Example**:
   ```bash
   python arl_gridworld_example.py
